# Post-DS v2.0 Documentation Action Plan

**Date**: 2025-10-16  
**Status**: Action Plan Ready  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Timeline**: 6 weeks (Week 1-6)  

---

## 📊 Quick Summary

**DS v2.0 Implementation**: ✅ **COMPLETE** (2025-10-16)

**What's Next**: Update all related documentation to reflect the 17 new + 4 enhanced data structures from DS v2.0.

**Critical Path**: CONTRACT_SPECIFICATIONS.md (blocks backend implementation)

---

## 🎯 Action Items by Week

### Week 1-2: CONTRACT_SPECIFICATIONS.md v2.0 🔥 **CRITICAL**

**Owner**: Frontend/Backend Team Leads  
**Priority**: **HIGH** (blocks implementation)

**Tasks**:

1. ✅ Create update plan (DONE - see [CONTRACT_SPECIFICATIONS_UPDATE_PLAN.md](./CONTRACT_SPECIFICATIONS_UPDATE_PLAN.md))
2. 📋 Implement 17 new Zod schemas for compliance modules
3. 📋 Enhance 4 existing Zod schemas (Electronic Signatures, Audit Trail, Users, GxP tables)
4. 📋 Add GxPValidationFieldsSchema mixin
5. 📋 Write unit tests for all schemas

**Deliverable**: CONTRACT_SPECIFICATIONS.md v2.0 (ETA: end of Week 2)

**Blocker Impact**: Backend cannot implement compliance modules without Zod schemas

---

**Deliverables**:

- Event architecture assessment
- API contracts generated
- Kafka topic definitions
- OpenAPI spec updated

---

### Week 4-5: Training & Roadmap Updates ⚪

**Priority**: **LOW** (but EU GMP required)

**Tasks**:

1. 📋 Assess training materials for DS v2.0 alignment
2. 📋 Update Curriculum.md with compliance training
3. 📋 Update PositionMatrix.md with GxP role qualifications
4. 📋 Review DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md
5. 📋 Update implementation timeline (Phase 3-5)

**Deliverables**:

- Training materials assessment
- Updated curriculum
- Updated roadmap

---

### Week 5-6: Compliance & SOP Updates ⚪

**Owners**: QA Manager, Compliance Officer  
**Priority**: **LOW** (but regulatory required)

**Tasks**:

1. 📋 Assess compliance documentation gaps
2. 📋 Create new SOPs (Change Control, CAPA, Validation Lifecycle)
3. 📋 Review existing SOPs for DS v2.0 alignment
4. 📋 Update cross-references
5. 📋 Document regulatory traceability

**Deliverables**:

- Compliance documentation assessment
- New SOPs created
- Updated cross-references
- Traceability matrix updated

## 📈 Progress Tracking

**Overall Documentation Completion**: **25%**

| Category | Weight | Status | Completion |
|----------|--------|--------|------------|
| Data Specifications | 30% | ✅ Complete | 100% |
| Contract Specifications | 25% | 📋 Planned | 0% |
| Architecture Docs | 15% | 🟡 Needs Review | 0% |
| Event Architecture | 10% | 🟡 Needs Review | 0% |
| Training Materials | 10% | ⚪ Not Assessed | 0% |
| Compliance Docs & SOPs | 10% | ⚪ Not Assessed | 0% |

**Next Milestone**: CONTRACT_SPECIFICATIONS.md v2.0 (ETA: Week 2 end)

---

## 🚨 Key Risks

### Risk 1: CONTRACT_SPECIFICATIONS.md Delays

**Impact**: Backend implementation blocked  
**Mitigation**: Prioritize critical schemas first, parallelize work across team

### Risk 2: Training Material Lag

**Impact**: EU GMP non-compliance (training required before system use)  
**Mitigation**: Start early (Week 3-4), involve Training Manager in DS v2.0 review

### Risk 3: SOP Creation Bottleneck

**Impact**: Regulatory inspection readiness  
**Mitigation**: Create templates, reuse existing patterns, developers draft SOPs
