# EU GMP Annex 11: Computerised Systems

## 1. Executive Summary

**EU GMP Annex 11** устанавливает принципы и требования для валидации и использования компьютеризированных систем в производстве лекарственных средств. Документ был пересмотрен в 2011 году с акцентом на:

- **Risk-based approach** к валидации систем
- **Data integrity** как ключевой приоритет
- **Supplier assessment** и управление поставщиками
- **Audit trail** требования для GxP-критичных данных
- **Electronic signatures** эквивалентность рукописным подписям

### 1.1 Applicability to GACP-ERP

    // Step 1: QC Manager enters results
    await this.enterQCResults(qcResults, { role: 'QC_MANAGER' });
    
    // Step 2: System validates against specifications
    const specCheck = await this.validateAgainstSpecs(batchId, qcResults);
    if (!specCheck.passed) {
      throw new OutOfSpecError('Batch does not meet specifications');
    }
    
    // Step 3: QC Manager recommends release (1st signature)
    await this.recordDecision(batchId, {
      decision: 'RECOMMEND_RELEASE',
      signedBy: qcManager,
      reasoning: 'All tests within specification'
    });
    
    // Step 4: QA Manager reviews and approves (2nd signature)
    // Annex 11, Clause 6 - second person review
    await this.requestSecondReview(batchId, { role: 'QA_MANAGER' });
    
    // Step 5: System enforces both signatures before release
    const signatures = await this.getSignatures(batchId);
    if (signatures.length < 2) {
      throw new InsufficientApprovalsError('Requires two approvals');
    }
    
    // Release approved
    await this.releaseBatch(batchId);
  }
}
```

    // Pre-release checks
    const checks = await this.performPreReleaseChecks(batchId);
    if (!checks.allPassed) {
      throw new ValidationError(
        `Pre-release checks failed: ${checks.failures.join(', ')}`
      );
    }
    
    // Require electronic signature
    const signature = await this.requestElectronicSignature(user, {
      action: 'RELEASE_BATCH',
      batchId: batchId,
      meaning: 'Approved for Distribution'
    });
    
    // Record release decision with full traceability
    await this.recordRelease({
      batchId,
      releasedBy: user.id,
      releasedByName: user.name,
      qualifiedPersonNumber: user.qpNumber,  // QP certification number

      // Clear identification (Annex 11 requirement)
      decision: 'RELEASED',
      rationale: 'All tests within specification, GMP compliant'
    });
    
    // Immutable audit trail
    await auditLog.record({
      eventType: 'BATCH_RELEASED',
      batchId,
      userId: user.id,
      signature: signature.hash
    });
    
    return { status: 'RELEASED', releaseNumber: await this.generateReleaseNumber(batchId) };
