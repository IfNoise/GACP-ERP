## SOP: Pest Control

### 1. Purpose

Установить комплексную систему интегрированного управления вредителями (IPM) для защиты растений каннабиса от болезней, насекомых-вредителей и других угроз, обеспечивая соответствие требованиям GACP и безопасность продукции.

### 2. Scope

Данная процедура охватывает:

- Профилактические меры и превентивные стратегии
- Мониторинг и раннее обнаружение вредителей
- Биологические методы контроля
- Физические и механические методы
- Химические средства защиты (при необходимости)
- Документирование и отчетность
- Управление резистентностью
- Обучение персонала

### 3. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Framework

#### 3.1 IPM Principles

```yaml
IPM_Strategy:
  prevention:
    priority: "Primary"
    methods: "Sanitation, quarantine, resistant varieties"
    sustainability: "Long-term effectiveness"

  monitoring:
    priority: "Secondary"
    methods: "Regular inspection, trap monitoring"
    frequency: "Daily visual, weekly detailed"

  biological_control:
    priority: "Tertiary"
    methods: "Beneficial insects, microorganisms"
    integration: "Natural ecosystem balance"

  physical_control:
    priority: "Quaternary"
    methods: "Barriers, traps, environmental manipulation"
    application: "Targeted intervention"

  chemical_control:

    ↓
Risk Assessment
    ↓
Low Risk → Monitor Only
    ↓
Medium Risk → Biological Control
    ↓
High Risk → Physical Control
    ↓
Critical Risk → Chemical Control (if approved)
    ↓
Effectiveness Evaluation
    ↓
Adjust Strategy Based on Results
