# Internal Communications System Documentation

## Purpose

This folder contains all Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) related to the **internal communication channels** of the GACP-compliant cannabis cultivation enterprise, including messaging, alerts, voice calls, and video conferencing built on **Jitsi infrastructure**.

## System Architecture Overview

The Internal Communications System is built on:

- **Jitsi Meet**: Complete video conferencing solution with screen sharing
- **Jitsi Videobridge (JVB)**: WebRTC-based selective forwarding unit for scalable media routing
- **Prosody XMPP Server**: Integrated messaging and signaling server (part of Jitsi stack)
- **Jicofo**: Jitsi Conference Focus for conference management and media negotiation
- **Jigasi**: SIP gateway for integration with external telephony systems
- **Kafka Integration**: Event streaming for audit trail and ERP integration
- **Keycloak SSO**: Single sign-on authentication and authorization via JWT tokens
- **immudb**: Immutable audit trail storage for regulatory compliance
- **MinIO/S3**: Object storage for recordings, attachments, and conference archives

## Scope

Covers all internal communication modalities:

- **Daily operational communication** between employees
- **Automated system alerts** from IoT, SCUD, and ERP modules
- **Secure voice calls** for operational coordination
- **Secure video conferences** for meetings, inspections, and audits

All communications must comply with **GACP/GMP** requirements, **ALCOA+** data integrity principles, and **MHRA Data Integrity** guidelines.

## SOPs Included

### Core Communication Procedures

- `SOP_InternalMessaging.md` — Secure text messaging, chat rooms, and instant communications
- `SOP_InternalAlerts.md` — Critical alerts, system notifications, and escalation procedures
- `SOP_VoiceCalls.md` — Internal VoIP calls using XMPP Jingle protocol
- `SOP_VideoConferencing.md` — Group video calls, remote inspections, and virtual meetings

### Technical Integration

- `SOP_XMPPIntegration.md` — Technical procedures for XMPP server management
- `SOP_CommunicationsAudit.md` — Audit trail procedures for communication events

## Regulatory Compliance Framework

### ALCOA+ Implementation

- **Attributable**: All communications linked to authenticated users via Keycloak
- **Legible**: Standardized message formats and encoding (UTF-8)
- **Contemporaneous**: Real-time timestamping synchronized across systems
- **Original**: Immutable storage in immudb with cryptographic hashing
- **Accurate**: Input validation and integrity checks
- **Complete**: Full message context and metadata preservation
- **Consistent**: Standardized communication protocols and formats
- **Enduring**: Long-term preservation with format migration strategies
- **Available**: Rapid retrieval with role-based access controls

### Integration with Other SOPs

| Communication Type         | Related SOPs                      | Integration Points                               |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Incident Communications    | SOP_IncidentManagement            | Automatic alert routing, escalation procedures   |
| Quality Communications     | SOP_CAPA, SOP_InternalAudits      | QA review discussions, audit coordination        |
| Security Communications    | SOP_ITSecurity, SOP_AccessControl | Security incident response, access notifications |
| Training Communications    | SOP_Training                      | Training announcements, competency assessments   |
| Operational Communications | SOP_ChangeControl                 | Change notifications, approval workflows         |

## Technical Architecture

### Message Flow Architecture

```
[IoT/SCUD/ERP Events] → [Kafka] → [XMPP Gateway] → [ejabberd/Prosody]
                                       ↓
[Mobile/Web Clients] ← [WebRTC Media] ← [Jingle Sessions]
                                       ↓
[Audit Trail Consumer] → [immudb] + [MinIO] (recordings/attachments)
```

### Security Framework

- **Authentication**: Keycloak OIDC/SASL integration
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC) mapping
- **Encryption**: TLS for signaling, SRTP for media
- **Data Protection**: End-to-end integrity with optional E2EE
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging of all communication events

### Data Classification

| Classification     | Examples                            | Audit Requirements     | Retention Period |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------- |
| **Critical/GMP**   | Batch discussions, QA reviews, CAPA | Full audit + recording | 5+ years         |
| **Operational**    | Shift communications, maintenance   | Metadata audit         | 2 years          |
| **Administrative** | General announcements, HR           | Basic logging          | 1 year           |
| **Personal**       | Casual conversations                | No audit (privacy)     | 30 days          |
