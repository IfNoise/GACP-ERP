# SOP: Out of Specification Investigation and Management

## 1. Purpose

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) establishes a systematic approach for investigating, documenting, and managing Out of Specification (OOS) results in analytical testing. It ensures that all OOS results are thoroughly investigated in accordance with regulatory requirements and that appropriate corrective and preventive actions are implemented to prevent recurrence.

## 2. Scope

This SOP applies to all analytical testing activities performed within the organization, including but not limited to:

- Raw material testing and release
